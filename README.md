# Aleshia's Prework Study Guide

## Development
This is a study guide for the coding bootcamp prework. I built this project because I wanted a simple way to learn the essentials of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I learned that HTML provides structure to a web application, CSS provides style, and JavaScripts provides functionality. I learned how to use GitBash commands in the command line and access repositories.

A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from Prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
